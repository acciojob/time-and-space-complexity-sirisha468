<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>
	<p>The time complexity, efficient of an algorithm quantifies the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the length of the input. Note that the time to run is a function of the length of the input and not the actual execution time of the machine on which the algorithm is running on.</p>
	<p><b>Space complexity</b>O(n) refers to the total amount of memory space used by an algorithm/program, including the space of input values for execution. Calculate the space occupied by variables in an algorithm/program to determine <b>space complexity</b.</p>
